Bookkeeper: Easily Manage Your Business Finances,Bookkeeping without an annual fee,5,"Considering the cost, I figured that for the price its a company trying to enter the market and compete with Quickbooks, so I ordered the software with an open mind.

Bookkeeper: Easily Manage Your Business Finances,Problems with the software & poor support,3,"I have a small business with one part-time employee to keep track of, needed the inventory, payroll and invoicing that comes with this.  Can not afford to spend $$ each month on one of the big boys so bought this one to upgrade from my old Bookkeeper.  The website said the latest included 2020 & 2021 tax tables.The box I bought does not say what version you have, you have to install it to find out what it is.The installation failed with transferring the old data & eventually I had to totally remove both programs and reinstall the new one & then laboriously rebuild all the 2020 information.When I started 2021 I found the tax tables were not here for that year, I would have to buy it.  Since I bought it in March of  2021, I would think it would be there.  Support says no, my version doesn't have the 2021 tax tables.  This is the version that is not mentioned anywhere on the box.  I can buy the tables for $30...which, since I paid $36 for this two months ago seems excessive...for one part time employee.Carrying on, I made out an invoice to a customer, who paid right away.  The invoice is for $76.83, customer paid $76.83, Bookkeeper changed the invoice to $75.85 and gave the customer a $.98 credit.Where did this come from?  I have checked & rechecked all the figures.  Even paying from the original invoice it changes the figure when I try to enter payment.Still waiting to hear from Tech support...but trying to find a work around.If anyone knows of another bookkeeping system for small businesses that actually work and are not full of unpleasant surprises please let me know.And, by the way, the included HELP files are generally useless.  If you are in a section working & in doubt, there is a HELP button, which does not take you to the topic you are on but to the beginning of the help and the introduction.

Bookkeeper: Easily Manage Your Business Finances,Buyer Beware!!!,1,"Okay.  I'm not one to bash any product, because I know products work differently for each individual.  However, my experience has been so horrific that I feel inclined to share.  I am a small business owner since 2005.  I started using bookkeeper since the start of my company.  Each year I've endured lagging tax table updates, worse yet lagging tax forms being released which resulted in late W2s being sent out one year, and problematic updates.  I stopped updating the software in 2009 because when I upgraded the software I had problems updating my database.  It took technical support two weeks before they fixed the problem and meanwhile I was handwriting employee checks (I know....embarassing).  I did, however, continue to update my tax tables and because they did not solve the tax form issues so close to the deadline, purchased separate software to process W2s.  Updating to 2011 was the WORST experience.  It took me 3 calls and I was put on hold at a minimum of 30 minutes each.  Roughly an hour and a half.  Because Avanquest couldn't solve the updating database issue (AGAIN!), I was transferred to Nova Development.  I was put in a queue of 11 (not bad) an hour and 45 minutes later...some dips--t picks up the phone and hangs up.  I was unable to breathe, I was so furious.  Well when Avanquest transferred me to them, they failed to give me ND's number.  So I had another 30 minutes on hold with Avanquest, explained my situation, asked to be directed to a supervisor at ND so I wouldn't have to hold, was IGNORED and put in a queue of 19!!!  45 minutes later, in tears, I broke and called my dad who thankfully has a pretty strong grasp of computers.  If you are updating your software follow carefully (1) first back up your database and email to yourself (2) wipe bookkeeper completely off your computer (3) download the newer software and install the tax tables (4) finish updating (because it downloads to a newer software version within 2011) the program.  When everything is updated, (5) save your database to your desktop (6) open bookkeeper and restore your database. Then make another update with the upgraded database.In summary, THREE hours and FORTY-FIVE minutes of panic and neither Avanquest or Nova solved my issue.  As a small business owner, I can't bill out the lost time and NEXT year....I'm investing in quickbooks.  GOOD LUCK if you do buy it or if you are not having issues (they will come).",buyer beware okay im one bash product know product work differently individual however experience horrific feel inclined share small business owner since started using bookkeeper since start company year ive endured lagging tax table update worse yet lagging tax form released resulted late w sent one year problematic update stopped updating software upgraded software problem updating database took technical support two week fixed problem meanwhile handwriting employee check knowembarassing however continue update tax table solve tax form issue close deadline purchased separate software process w updating worst experience took call put hold minimum minute roughly hour half avanquest couldnt solve updating database issue transferred nova development put queue bad hour minute latersome dipst pick phone hang unable breathe furious well avanquest transferred failed give nd number another minute hold avanquest explained situation asked directed supervisor nd wouldnt hold ignored put queue minute later tear broke called dad thankfully pretty strong grasp computer updating software follow carefully first back database email wipe bookkeeper completely computer download newer software install tax table finish updating downloads newer software version within program everything updated save database desktop open bookkeeper restore database make another update upgraded databasein summary three hour fortyfive minute panic neither avanquest nova solved issue small business owner cant bill lost time next yearim investing quickbooks good luck buy issue come,NEGATIVE,0.998241305,-0.118055556,0.45,Negative

Dave Ramsey&#39;s Financial Peace Workplace Edition - Membership Kit,"Any Version of Dave Ramsey's Finanical Peace University gives Priceless, Life changning Info.",5,"FABULOUS product.  I was fortunate to find two of these factory sealed items for under $20 including shipping each (they sell at auction sites for over $50 each plus shipping in Used and incomplete editions.  One was for me, the other is a gift to my niece and her husband.  I immediately found $300 a month I was wasting.  Yes I DID find it difficult to change habits, but I wanted to change my life so that if I wanted to take early retirement in 5 years, I could.  It is a wonderful feeling to know I can choose to retire rather than be forced to work.  Yes, I have a 401K, I paid off all my student loan debt (for 3 degrees) before FPU; but I also USED to NOT have credit card debt as I do now etc.. I started bad habits and now FPU is helping me get back into good ones.As for the product, I had a chance to compare this Workplace edition from approx. 2008-2010 to the current Government online version.  The PDF file of the workbook downloaded in this month of August 2015 had (9 lessons + 3 Bonus); while the printed leather bound workbook had 13 chapters.  The lessons are not exactly in the same order, and a name or two has changed slightly.  But it is easy to match them up.  Yes the graphics or page layouts have changed a bit too.  But the questions per lesson and answer sheets at the end of each chapter appear to line up  in order exactly for both. The missing chapter from prior years is titled ""The Great Misunderstanding"" and really seems to explain Giving and tithing from a biblical and Christian stewardship of God's Funds perspective.  I think it was left out of the Government edition to prevent issues regarding religious conflict.This really is priceless, life changing information! Doing the budget was the hardest part.  I like the way Dave builds bridges for conversation between couples so the ""stickler"" who has a spreadsheet for his/her spreadsheets and the free spirit spouse work together.Oh the hardbound book in this older version is ""Financial Peace Revisited"".  I personally prefer the layout of his: “Complete Guide to Money: The Handbook of FPU”.  I am a person who loves to have the ""new shiny thing."" So, yes I still want to newest version of the FPU system.  But my older, yet still brand new in shrink wrap version has worked perfectly and appears to have given me every nugget of wisdom his new course offers. Admittedly, Dave is a master at rinsing and retooling his information.  In fact many ""Info-Product guru's"" teach that strategy.I am not attempting to start a debate, just trying to let people know that the biblical principles are there, but did not strike me as being forced down my throat; someone else could disagree.  I have not viewed that 13th lesson so I cannot say much about it.",version dave ramseys finanical peace university give priceless life changning info fabulous product fortunate find two factory sealed item including shipping sell auction site plus shipping used incomplete edition one gift niece husband immediately found month wasting yes find difficult change habit wanted change life wanted take early retirement year could wonderful feeling know choose retire rather forced work yes k paid student loan debt degree fpu also used credit card debt etc started bad habit fpu helping get back good onesas product chance compare workplace edition approx current government online version pdf file workbook downloaded month august lesson bonus printed leather bound workbook chapter lesson exactly order name two changed slightly easy match yes graphic page layout changed bit question per lesson answer sheet end chapter appear line order exactly missing chapter prior year titled great misunderstanding really seems explain giving tithing biblical christian stewardship god fund perspective think left government edition prevent issue regarding religious conflictthis really priceless life changing information budget hardest part like way dave build bridge conversation couple stickler spreadsheet hisher spreadsheet free spirit spouse work togetheroh hardbound book older version financial peace revisited personally prefer layout complete guide money handbook fpu person love new shiny thing yes still want newest version fpu system older yet still brand new shrink wrap version worked perfectly appears given every nugget wisdom new course offer admittedly dave master rinsing retooling information fact many infoproduct guru teach strategyi attempting start debate trying let people know biblical principle strike forced throat someone else could disagree viewed th lesson say much,NEGATIVE,0.985253036,0.214604377,0.461952862,Positive
